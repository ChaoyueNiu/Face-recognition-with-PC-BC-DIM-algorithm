this original code is from http://www.pudn.com/ 
To meet the requirement of project, i have modified some area of manual program and automatic program.
Automatically: 
run the demo, after alignment will be automatically generated in the root directory of images
 
Manually: 
run getAlignedFace_demo, then select the image to be manually adjusted, and the result will be in the corresponding folder in the root directory. 
 
att_faces is pgm format of ORL dataset
